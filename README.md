# Mars Lander Controller

This is my codebase for the Mars Lander project, completed after part IA of the engineering tripos as an introduction to coding in C++.  

The file `lander` contains the implementation of the mars lander module's dynamics as well as means to graphically simulate the experiment.  Control is implemented using simple PID control.
